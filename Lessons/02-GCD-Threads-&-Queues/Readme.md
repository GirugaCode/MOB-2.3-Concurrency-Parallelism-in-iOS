## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe
1. Define
1. Design
1. Implement

## Initial Exercise (15 min)


<!-- - Funny comic
- Prime the Pump (e.g. think and jot, think pair share, etc)
- Productivity Tip/Tool
- Review of current event (e.g. tech news relevant to your track/topic)
- Quiz on homework or topic(s) of past class
- Concept Test -->

## Overview/TT I (20 min)

In iOS, Concurrency can by handled by two APIs:
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)
- Operations

> We will Operations in upcoming lessons. We will also learn about the differences between GCD and Operations, as well as when to choose one API over the other...


which to use? In general, GCD is good to use for simple jobs/tasks, Operations make it easier to do complex jobs/tasks. <complex? the amount of communication between tasks and how closely you want to monitor execution >

Operations are objects that encapsulate data and functionality.

In GCD, you are working with functions.


< How iOS uses GCD - other platforms use x (which was supposed to be in Swift 5, but deferred) >


### What is GCD?

< GCD is named after Grand Central Station...


### why use it? What does it do?

< purpose -- queues >

### Dispatch Queues

FIFO
Serial / Concurrent
QoS Priority
Default Queues
Custom Queues
Main Queue

#### FIFO

#### serial queues


#### concurrent queues

	- requires QoS Priority

##### QoS levels


#### Default Queues


#### Custom Queues


### The Main queue




## In Class Activity I (30 min)

- I do, We do, You do
- Reading & Discussion Questions in small groups
- Draw a picture/diagram
- Complete Challenges solo or in pair
- Q&A about tutorials
- Pair up and code review
- Pair program
- Formative assessment
- Form into groups
- etc (get creative :D)

## Overview/TT II (optional) (20 min)

### Sync vs async


#### Calling Sync on Current Queue

< never call Sync on main queue >
