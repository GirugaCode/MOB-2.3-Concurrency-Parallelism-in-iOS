# MOB-2.3 - Concurrency & Parallelism in iOS

## Course Description
This course covers concurrency and parallelism in iOS to optimize programming performance on mobile devices which built with multiple cores. Students will learn the foundation of Grand Central Dispatch and build applications that run multiple tasks simultaneously which improves speed. 

## Prerequisites:  

[MOB 2.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.1-Local-Persistence-in-iOS)

## Topics
- Concurrency
- Parallelism
- GCD
- Operations
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- Delayed task execution
- DispatchWorkItem
- Concurrent Loops
- Problems with Concurrency & Shared Memory
  - Deadlocks
  - Race Conditions
  - Readers-Writers Problem
  - Thread explosion
  - Priority inversion
- Interview challenges in iOS
- Testing in iOS (XCTest, Quick & Nimble)
- Xcode Project Management (Schemes, Targets, Build settings)

## Competencies

By the end of this class students will:
- know the difference between concurrency & parallelism
- know how to create serial and concurrent queues
- know how to create delayed tasks
- know how to identify deadlocks, race conditions and priority inversion in multi-threaded code
- practice common iOS interview projects & questions
- leverage various concepts in Grand Central Dispatch to use in their projects
- learn how to test code in iOS
- learn how to use Xcode's project management tools to build better projects
